# Choose Your Own Adventure

My answer to this Gophercise: https://github.com/gophercises/cyoa

Choose Your Own Adventure is a web application where each page will be a portion of the story, 
and at the end of every page the user will be given a series of options to choose from 
(or be told that they have reached the end of that particular story arc).

## How to run
